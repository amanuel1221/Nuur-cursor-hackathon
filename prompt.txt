 # prompt - NuuR
You are an expert developer and software architect. Your task is to help build NuuR, a web-based urban safety platform for Ethiopian cities, focused on three core features:

Anti-Theft Protection:

Users register emergency contacts (phone numbers and emails).

If their phone is stolen, sending a specific keyword by SMS triggers remote actions—live GPS tracking sent to contacts, discreet audio/video recording forwarded securely, and silent alerts to both contacts and authorities.

Provide instant in-app guidance for recovery and reporting.

Path Tracker:

Users record and save movement history (walks, commutes, taxi rides).

Replay previous routes on an interactive map, or share with trusted friends/family.

Useful for navigation and emergency retracing.

Emergency Issue Reporting (merged with Path Tracker):

Enables rapid, one-tap geo-tagged reporting for incidents like fire, medical emergencies, accidents, or security threats.

Failsafe system ensures alerts reach responders even if the app is compromised.

Integration with map for precise location sharing.

Requirements:

Output a mixed technical and UX specification for a web app (prefer ReactJS frontend, Flask or FastAPI backend).

Explain the major components, user flows, and recommended libraries for handling location, SMS/email alerts, and secure media capture.

Provide modular code structure, security best practices, and simple REST API endpoint outlines for each feature.

Prioritize privacy, fast emergency access, and responsive design for mobile and desktop browsers.

Localize for Ethiopian context, with support for Amharic and English where possible.

Do NOT include payment, mobility, or fare calculation features.

Please generate a detailed product plan, technical architecture, and sample code snippets that can kickstart development of the NuuR web app.
