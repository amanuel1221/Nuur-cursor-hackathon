## NuuR: Urban Light for Safety, Trust & Mobility

## Problem Statement

**Urban residents and travelers, especially in rapidly growing regions like Ethiopia, face daily risks from smartphone theft, unreliable navigation, financial fraud, slow emergency responses, and uncertain urban mobility.**

- **Phone theft** leads to the loss of devices, critical information, and personal security, often leaving victims without recourse or help.
    
- **Navigational challenges** for newcomers make it easy to get lost, feel unsafe, and struggle to return to familiar or important places.
    
- **Mobile payment fraud** and transparency barriers mean it’s difficult to confirm if financial transactions are legitimate.
    
- **Emergency reporting** is often slow and complicated, with many unable to quickly alert responders during accidents, disasters, or assaults.
    
- **Urban transport costs** and reliability issues frustrate users seeking fair, safe, and affordable rides.
    

These problems threaten safety, financial confidence, and the overall urban experience for millions of youth, families, and commuters.
