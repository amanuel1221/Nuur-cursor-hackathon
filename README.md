## NuuR: Urban Light for Safety, Trust & Mobility

***

### Problem Statement

Urban residents and travelers—especially in rapidly growing regions like Ethiopia—face daily risks from smartphone theft, unreliable navigation, slow or ineffective emergency responses, and unsafe urban environments.  
- **Phone theft** not only deprives victims of valuable devices, but can also compromise critical information and personal safety, often leaving users with no recourse.  
- **Navigational challenges**—particularly for newcomers—make it easy to get lost, feel unsafe, and struggle to return to important places or seek help.  
- **Emergency situations** such as accidents, fires, or medical incidents demand fast, geo-tagged reports, but most systems are slow or inaccessible in moments of crisis.  
These issues threaten safety, confidence, and the overall urban experience for millions of people in cities.
